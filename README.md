# IMUMocap
https://youtu.be/WlvOCEbqrtQ
I decided to create Ð¼otion capture suit with IMU sensor 6050 and data transfer with esp8866 to Autodesk MotionBuilder.
My project is inspired by https://github.com/herzig/bewegungsfelder , https://github.com/nkeeline/KeeCap-Open-Motion-Capture-Suit and https://github.com/OlafHaag/MotionBuilder-LiveSkeleton-Plugin

My project consists of the following:
1. The mpu6050 sensors generate data about their rotation from the moment they are turned on
2. esp8866 collects this data and sends it to the BWFGscanner via wifi
3. BWFGscanner collect data from all sensors and put it in the memory mapped file
4. Ordeviceskeleton read this data, use them to rotate and positioning bones
